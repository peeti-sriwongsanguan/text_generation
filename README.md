This project aims to build a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system that translates sentences from English to German using a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers and Transformer techniques. The system leverages deep learning to produce high-quality translations for various applications, such as language localization, content translation, and more.

## Introduction

Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a powerful application of deep learning in the field of natural language processing (NLP). It involves training neural networks to translate text from one language to another. This project focuses on building an NMT system that translates English sentences into German using a combination of RNN-LSTM and Transformer techniques.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- pandas
- transformers
- scikit-learn
- gensim
- pydot

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow tensorflow-datasets tensorflow-text keras numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn pydot gensim transformers
```

## Data Preparation

To train and evaluate the NMT model, you will need parallel text data containing German sentences and their corresponding English translations. Common datasets for this task I used the IMDB dataset delivered as part of the TensorFlow-datasets library.

1. Download the parallel text dataset in German and English.
2. Preprocess the data by tokenizing the sentences using Word2Vec-based Models.

## Model Architecture

The NMT model combines the strengths of RNN-LSTM and Transformer architecture:

- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture:** The model consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder processes the input German sentence, while the decoder generates the corresponding English sentence.

- **RNN-LSTM Layers:** The encoder utilizes RNN-LSTM layers to capture sequential information from the German sentence.

- **Transformer Layers:** The decoder incorporates Transformer layers to improve translation quality by focusing on relevant parts of the input sentence.

- **Attention Mechanism:** The model uses an attention mechanism to align and weight input words during the translation process, enhancing the quality of translations.

- **Embedding Layers:** Both the encoder and decoder have embedding layers to convert words into continuous vector representations.

- **Final Dense Layer:** The output layer of the decoder provides the probability distribution over English words, allowing for word generation.

## Training

To train the NMT model:

1. Split the parallel dataset into training and validation sets.
2. Define the model architecture and compile it.
3. Train the model using the training data and validate it using the validation data.
4. Tune hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, and model architecture to optimize performance.
5. Monitor training loss and validation metrics, such as BLEU score, to gauge the model's performance.

## Inference

Once the model is trained, you can use it to translate German sentences into English. To perform inference:

1. Tokenize and preprocess the German sentence.
2. Feed the preprocessed sentence into the encoder.
3. Generate the English translation using the decoder.
4. Post-process the generated English sentence (e.g., detokenization).

## Evaluation

Evaluate the NMT model using appropriate metrics such as:

- **BLEU Score:** Measure the quality of translations by comparing them to reference translations.
- **Perplexity:** Assess the model's confidence in its predictions.
- **Translation Quality:** Collect human evaluations to assess the translation quality subjectively.

## Future Improvements

- Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to improve translation quality.
- Explore data augmentation techniques to enhance the model's performance.
- Implement techniques like beam search or nucleus sampling for better translation generation.
- Fine-tune the model on domain-specific data to improve translation accuracy for specific use cases.
